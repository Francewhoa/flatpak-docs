"Flatpak repositories are the primary mechanism for publishing "
"applications, so that they can be installed by users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some aspects of repositories are addressed by other sections of the "
"documentation. Basic commands for adding, removing and inspecting "
"repositories can be found in the :doc:`using-flatpak` section. "
"Additionally, the section on :doc:`flatpak-builder` covers the most "
"common method for adding applications to repositories."

"To use a repository to publish an application, it is possible to either "
"host your own (covered in the next section, :doc:`hosting-a-repository`) "
"or use `Flathub <https://flathub.org>`_, the primary publishing and "
"hosting service for Flatpak applications."

msgid ""
"Software center applications like GNOME Software or KDE Discover allow "
"browsing repositories, and can also dynamically promote new or popular "
"applications. If you use Flathub, the repository will typically have "
"already been added by users, so adding an application to the repository "
"is sufficient to make it available to them."

"``.flatpakref`` files can be used in combination with repositories to "
"provide an additional, easy way for users to install an application, "
"often by clicking on the file or a download link."

"Internally, ``.flatpakref`` files are simple description files that "
"include information about a Flatpak application. An example::"

"As can be seen, the file includes the ID of the application and the "
"location of the repository that contains it, as well a link to "
"information about the repository that provides the application's runtime."
" ``.flatpakref`` files therefore contain all the information needed to "
"install an application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../repositories.rst:50

"``.flatpakref`` files should include the base64-encoded version of the "
"GPG key that was used to sign the repository. This can be obtained with "
"the following command::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../repositories.rst:56
msgid ""
"One advantage of ``.flatpakref`` files is that they can be used to "
"install applications even if their repository hasn't been added by the "
"user. In this case the repository that contains the application will "
"either be automatically installed, or the user will be prompted to "
"install it. This will also happen if the necessary runtime isn't present."

#: ../../repositories.rst:62
msgid ""
"``.flatpakref`` can be used to install applications from the command line"
" as well as with graphical software installers. This is done with the "
"standard ``flatpak install`` command, which accepts both local and remote"
" ``.flatpakref`` files. For example::"

#: ../../repositories.rst:77
msgid ""
"Flatpak repositories are similar to Git repositories, in that they store "
"every version of an application by keeping a record of the difference "
"between each version. This makes updating efficient, since only the "
"difference (or \"delta\") between two versions needs to be downloaded "
"when an update is performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../repositories.rst:82
msgid ""
"When a new version of an application is added to a repository, it "
"immediately becomes available to users. Software centers are able to "
"automatically check for and install new versions. Those who are using the"
" command line have to manually run ``flatpak update`` to check for and "
"install new versions of any applications they have installed."
