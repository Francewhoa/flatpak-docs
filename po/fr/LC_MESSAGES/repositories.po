"Software center applications like GNOME Software or KDE Discover allow "

"already been added by users, so adding an application to the repository "

"One advantage of ``.flatpakref`` files is that they can be used to "

"``.flatpakref`` can be used to install applications from the command line"

"Flatpak repositories are similar to Git repositories, in that they store "
"every version of an application by keeping a record of the difference "
"between each version. This makes updating efficient, since only the "
"difference (or \"delta\") between two versions needs to be downloaded "
"when an update is performed."

#: ../../repositories.rst:82
msgid ""
"When a new version of an application is added to a repository, it "
"immediately becomes available to users. Software centers are able to "
"automatically check for and install new versions. Those who are using the"
" command line have to manually run ``flatpak update`` to check for and "
"install new versions of any applications they have installed."
